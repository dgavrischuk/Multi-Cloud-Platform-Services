* default values outside of variable declarations should be kept in locals sections
* hard-coded values (I.e. for security) should be added in a locals section and evaluated in other
blocks from there
* Cloud Service Provider (CSP) modules should be kept in the CSP named directory
* MCP module is considered a special module for MCCF adapters for serverless deployment modules
